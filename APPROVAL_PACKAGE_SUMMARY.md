## 🎓 Appendix: Technology Background

**What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**

RAG combines:
1. **Retrieval:** Search historical data for relevant examples
2. **Augmentation:** Add context to LLM prompt
3. **Generation:** Use LLM to generate structured output

**Why Phi-4 LLM?**
- Small (3.8B parameters) vs GPT-4 (1.7T)
- Fast inference (2-5 sec vs 30+ sec for large models)
- Free to run locally
- 95-97% accuracy (vs 98% for GPT-4)
- Zero external API calls = 100% data privacy

**Total System Advantages:**
- Local, private, secure
- Cost-effective
- Fast inference
- Easy to understand & debug
- Meets all compliance requirements

**APPROVAL REQUIRED:**
- [ ] Finance: Budget approval ($20,500)
- [ ] Technology: Architecture approval
